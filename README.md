# Typing-Speed-Tester

Typing Speed Tester is my first Javascript project. Uses vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascipt. This website has you type a randomly generated sequence of words for 60 seconds and outputs your WPM typing speed, your Keystrokes, Correct words and Incorrect words. I have linked the website for you to check out below.
